## General info

Entangled is based on the idea of a escape room, where the main char, woke up in a strange place, and receives some tips to where he is and what he needs to do in order to escape from that place.

His movements works pressing the letters ‘w’ for going up, ‘s’ for down, ‘a’ for left and ‘d’ for right. The interaction with objects can be done pressing ‘enter’.

As soon as the game begins and the user tries to walk, a dialogue box appears, showing some content and giving the user a main idea of what could be happen with the char. There is a tip that indicates that the user has to move the char to the computer to check what is happening, but as soon as he interacts with it, a timer of X minutes begins and he has a limited time to find the other key that is hidden in the map and scape from that place.

The first key can easily be found on the floor in the first scenery, together with a boot, that can add some speed to the char. With the first key in hands, he will be able to open the first door and go to the next scenery. At this moment the user will see that there is another door at the end of the hall, however he will not be able to go through it without a key. In order to find the next key the user will have to try to interact with the objects that is in this room trying to find another clue to where the second key may be.

The main objective is to leave the room and enter in the boat before the timer is over, so he can survive and leave the place.

For this game, it was used as a model the game "The Blue Boy Adventure" from the YouTuber, RyiSnow, that developed a RPG game and we adapted it for our game. It can be found in the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq
The tiles of the game were created on the software called Paint, where it we draw it pixel by pixel. In order to organize our map, we used a program also created by RyiSnow that manipulates the txt file in order to make it easier to visualize the map content, called Simple2DTileEditor1.01(EXE).
